Load the cdc data frame by using load(url("url_to_your_data_set")).
# Load the cdc data frame into the workspace:
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/dasi/cdc.Rdata"))


Use the names(your_data_frame) function to view the variables of the data frame.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Print the names of the variables:
names(cdc)


Use the head() and tail() functions to view first and last entries of the data frame.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Print the head and tails of the data frame:
head(cdc)
tail(cdc)


How many cases and how many variables are there in the cdc data set? This data set is available 
in the workspace; you can inspect it by executing cdc in the console on the right.
9 cases; 20,000 variables
press 1
10 cases; 20,000 variables
press 2
20,000 cases; 9 variables <--
press 3
20,000 cases; 10 variables
press 4


Take a look at the height and genhlth variables of the cdc data frame. Use the head() 
functions to avoid flooding your console!
Assign the sum of 84941 and 19686 to the object sum.
Assign the multiplication of 73 and 51 to the object mult.

# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# View the head or tail of both the height and the genhlth variables:
head(cdc$height)
head(cdc$genhlth)

# Assign your sum here:
sum <-84941 + 19686

# Assign your multiplication here:
mult <- 73 * 51


Calculate the mean, var and median of the weight variable of your data frame. 
(Just print it, no need to assign objects.)
Use the summary() function to see some numerical facts about the weight variable of 
your data frame. (Again just print it.)

# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace
mean(cdc$weight)
var(cdc$weight)
median(cdc$weight)
summary(cdc$weight)



Use the table() function to create the frequency table for genhlth.
Now create the relative frequency table for the same variable.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# Create the frequency table here:
table(cdc$genhlth)

# Create the relative frequency table here:
table(cdc$genhlth) / 20000



Draw the barplot with the table with the categorical data of smoke100 as input. 
(You can do this in one line by nesting table() inside barplot()!)
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# Draw the barplot:
barplot(table(cdc$smoke100))


Use the table() function to see how many participants have smoked across each gender. 
Assign this table to gender_smokers.
Plot the contents of this table using the mosaicplot() function.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# How many participants have smoked across gender?
gender_smokers <- table(cdc$gender, cdc$smoke100)

# Print out gender_smokers
gender_smokers 

# Plot the mosaicplot
mosaicplot(gender_smokers)


interlude: How R thinks about data 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assign the height of the 1337th respondent to height_1337 using the row-and-column notation. 
(Use names to see what the index of height is.)
Assign the weight of the 111th respondent to weight_111 using the row-and-column notation.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Create the subsets
height_1337 <- cdc[1337, 5]
weight_111 <- cdc[111, 6]

# Print the results
height_1337
weight_111


Assign the variables between and including hlthplan and height for the first 8 respondents to first8.
Assign the variables between and including weight to gender for respondents 10 to 20 to wt_gen_10_20.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Create the subsets
first8 <- cdc[1:8, 3:5]
wt_gen_10_20 <- cdc[10:20, 6:9]

# Print the subsets
first8
wt_gen_10_20


Assign all variables for the 205th respondent to resp205.
Assign the variables height and weight for all respondents to ht_wt.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Create the subsets
resp205 <- cdc[205, ]
ht_wt <- cdc[ , 5:6]

# Print the subsets
resp205
head(ht_wt)


Assign the smoking status (smoke100) of the 1000th respondent to resp1000_smk.
Assign the data containing the height of the first 30 respondents to first30_ht.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Create the subsets
resp1000_smk <- cdc$smoke100[1000]
first30_ht <- cdc$height[1:30]

# Print the subsets
resp1000_smk
first30_ht



Use the subset() function to assign the subset of people in very good general health to very_good.
Assign the subset of people aged over 50 (excluding 50) to age_gt50.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Create the subsets
very_good <- subset(cdc, cdc$genhlth == "very good")
age_gt50 <- subset(cdc, cdc$age > 50)

# Print the subsets
head(very_good)
head(age_gt50)



Create a new object called under23_and_smoke that contains all observations of respondents 
under the age of 23 that have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace

# Create the subset
under23_and_smoke <- subset(cdc, cdc$age < 23 & cdc$smoke100 == 1)

# Print the top six rows of the subset
head(under23_and_smoke)



Draw a box plot of height using the boxplot() function.
Use the summary() function to also get a numerical summary of the variable.
Compare the two results.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# Draw the box plot of the respondents heights
boxplot(cdc$height)

# Print the summary
summary(cdc$height)



Use the ~ notation to box plot the weight of respondents as a function of whether or not 
they smoke (smoke100).
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# Draw the box plot of the weights versus smoking
boxplot(cdc$weight ~ cdc$smoke100)



Consider the Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a weight to height ratio and can be calculated as:

BMI = weight(lb) / height(in)^2 Ã— 703

Calculate the BMI for each respondent and assign the result to bmi.
Draw a box plot of the BMI versus the general health of the respondents.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# Calculate the BMI:
bmi <- cdc$weight / (cdc$height * cdc$height) * 703

# Draw the box plot:
boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$genhlth)


Histograms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draw a histogram of the bmi object we created in the previous exercise using the hist() function. 
(bmi is already loaded in the workspace.)
Play around with different values for the breaks argument. 
Try 50 and 100 and see how it affects the generated graph.
# The cdc data frame and bmi object are already loaded into the workspace.

# Draw a histogram of bmi
hist(bmi)

# And one with breaks set to 50
hist(bmi, breaks = 50)

# And one with breaks set to 100
hist(bmi, breaks = 100)



Use the plot() function to make a scatterplot of the weight variable versus the wtdesire variable. 
Both these variables can be found in the cdc data frame which is already available in the workspace.
# The cdc data frame is already loaded into the workspace.

# Draw your plot here
plot(cdc$weight, cdc$wtdesire)
