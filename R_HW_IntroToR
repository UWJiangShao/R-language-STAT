Load in the present data set with the help of the read.table() 
function and assign the result to the object present. Your code 
should look something like: read.table("dataset_url"). Use the quotes 
" to tell R the provided url is a string (a sequence of characters) and not an object.

# Read in your data set and assign to the object:
present <- read.table("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/dasi/present.txt");

# This will print your data set in the console:
present





Print the names of the present data frame.
Print the dimensions of the present data frame.

# The present data frame is already loaded
present
# Print the number of rows and variables with the dim() function:
dim(present)

# Print the names of the variables of the data frame:
names(present)




Say you want to view the number of boys born each year. Make use of the 
my_data_frame$variable_name structure, and assign the result to num_boys.
Now calculate the number of girls born each year, and assign the results to num_girls.

# The present dataset is already loaded
present
# Find the number of boys born each year
num_boys <- present$boys

# Find the number of girls born each year
num_girls <- present$girls

# This will print the results
num_boys
num_girls





Plot the number of girls born per year on the y-axis vs. the year on the x-axis. 
Make sure to use the my_data_frame$variable_name structure twice.

# The present dataset is already loaded
present

# Type here the code to create the plot:
plot(present$year, present$girls)




Adapt the plot to create a line plot instead of a dot plot.

# The present dataset is already loaded

# Adapt the code to create a line plot
plot(x = present$year, y = present$girls), type = "l")
